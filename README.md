# Digit Recigntion Program
This is a super simple digit recognition program using Pytorch and a simple convolutional neural network. It allows users to input their own .jpg image through the command line and have it recognized as one of the ten digits. The accuracy on the MNIST validation dataset is ~99%.
## Todo:
* ~Implement a way for users to input their own image.~
* Add an algorithm to detect multiple digits from a user input image
